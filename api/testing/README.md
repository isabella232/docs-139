# 🔬 Testing

We recommend the [**@web/test-runner**](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/) tool, if your project was created with the command `npm init @atomico` the test environment will be preconfigured, you can see this pre-configuration at [https://github.com/atomicojs/base/tree/2-started](https://github.com/atomicojs/base/tree/2-started).

### Advanced \(Documentation in progress\)

To scale the test environment you can complement with tools such as:

1. \*\*\*\*[**Cypress**](https://www.cypress.io/): allows you to automate interactions and evaluate interactions of your interface. 
2. \*\*\*\*[**Percy**](https://percy.io/): Allows you to evaluate the appearance changes of your component or application between versions.
